// Part Four: Explore the URL API

// 1. At times, itâ€™s useful for your JavaScript to look at the URL of the browser 
//    window and change how the script works depending on parts of that (particularly 
//    the query string).
// 2. Read about the URL API at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL
// 3. Try some of the code examples in the Chrome Console so that you can get 
//    comfortable with the basic methods and properties for instances of the URL class.

let m = 'https://developer.mozilla.org';
let a = new URL("/", m); 
let b = new URL(m);
let d = new URL('/en-US/docs', b);
