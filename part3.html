<!-- Part Three: Explore Dev Tools

1. Build a very simple HTML form that uses the GET method (it can use the same page 
   URL for the action) when the form is submitted.
2. Add a field or two to the form and, after submitting it, explore in Chrome 
   Developer tools how you can view the request and response headers.
3. Edit the page to change the form type to POST, refresh in the browser and 
   re-submit. Do you still see the field in the query string? Explore in Chrome how 
   you can view the request and response headers, as well as the form data. -->
